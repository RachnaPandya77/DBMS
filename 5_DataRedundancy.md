## What do you understand By Data Redundancy?

<hr>

- Data redundancy occurs when the same data is stored in multiple places within a database or system. This can lead to inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and potential data integrity issues.

**Strategies to reduce data redundancy**

- **Normalization:** Organizing data into tables that minimize redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Data warehousing:** Centralizing data from multiple sources into a single repository.
- **Data cleansing:** Identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies in data.
- **Data deduplication:** Identifying and removing duplicate data records.
