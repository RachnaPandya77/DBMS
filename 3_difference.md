| DBMS                                                                      | RDBMS                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Flexible data organization(structured, semi-structured unstructured)      | structured data(Tables, rows, column)                                                            |
| No inherit support for relatuonship                                       | Strong relatuonships defined through keys                                                        |
| Lower complexity                                                          | Higher complexity                                                                                |

| There is some normalization                                               | Normalization is not possible                                                                    |
