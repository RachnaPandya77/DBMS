| DBMS                                                                      | RDBMS                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Flexible data organization(structured, semi-structured unstructured)      | structured data(Tables, rows, column)                                                            |
| The amount of data stored is small                                        | A large amount of data is stored                                                                 |
| Lower complexity                                                          | Higher complexity                                                                                |
| Use cases include document managment, email, archiving, unstructured data | Use case include transactional database, financial records, customer managment, complex analysis |
| There is some normalization                                               | Normalization is not possible                                                                    |
